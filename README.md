🎮 Junior Game Developer | Unity Enthusiast | Crafting Fun and Connection

Hey there, I'm Art - Supanat Ubonpun, a junior game developer on an exciting journey to bring joy and interactivity to virtual realms. My playground of choice is the Unity platform, where I use the magic of C# to shape gameplay and create experiences that resonate with players.

🕹️ Playful Unity Proficiency: I might be a junior, but I'm no stranger to Unity's toolkit. With C# as my trusty sidekick, I'm diving headfirst into the world of scripting, mechanics, and all things game development.

🌐 Exploring the Gameverse: From PCs to the web's open canvas (WebGL) and the adventure-friendly Android, I'm eager to explore every nook and cranny of game development. Embracing the challenges and learning curves is all part of the ride!

💡 Learning by Doing: Each project I tackle is a chance to level up, refine my skills, and gather wisdom from both successes and oopsie-daisy moments. Growth is the name of the game!

🤝 Ready for Quests: I'm all ears for collaboration! If you're a fellow coder, artist, or just someone with a passion for pixels, I'm up for teaming up to create pixel-perfect worlds and stories.

🚀 Showcasing My Arsenal: My toolkit might be growing, but I'm excited to share the creations I've conjured so far. Explore below and join me in celebrating the small victories and big aspirations.

📬 Whether you're a fellow traveler on this game development quest or someone intrigued by the magic we weave, don't hesitate to drop a line. The world of bits and bytes is our canvas, and I'm thrilled to paint some memories on it!
